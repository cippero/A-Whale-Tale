## Game Objectives
The objective of the game is to guide Wally to his pod while staying alive.

## Instructions
Use the keyboard arrow keys to swim up/down/left/right. Wally starts at the left end of the level and must find his way to his pod at the right end of the level. Avoid the bombs that are released by the evil robot submarines, but don't be afraid to ram the submarines themselves and gather the stars that they drop.

## How to Win
Find your pod while staying alive!

## How to Lose
If you get hit by enough bombs Wally's health will go to zero and he will die :(
